      <h1> Why I hate these kinds of assignments </h1>
      <h2> 1) Lack of Ideas </h2>
      <p1> These types of "free and creative" assignments that allow you to do what you want is a real pain to deal with if you aren't one of those people with weirdly high imaginative capabilities. You often get stuck at choosing what to actually do, rather than doing the assignment itself. It becomes a huge problem where you have to desperately choose something to do, even if it may not be a good subject for the assignment.</p1>
      <h2> 2) Expectations </h2>
      <p2>What also usually comes with these assignments are expectations of something great. Since you have the freedom to do whatever you want, people expect you to do your very best in whatever it is. It just really applies pressure and heavily affects one's decision making, knowing they might not be satisfied with the current state of your work.</p2>
      <h2> 3) Time Constraints </h2>
      <p3> Since you likely spent an excessive time choosing what to do, you are left with little time to actually do it. The assignment usually gives more time before it's due than other work, but it really doesn't if you don't already know exactly what you want to do for it. You would spend all the time agonizing over what to do and be left with less time than usual to finish the assignment.It's been a consistent pain for me to come up with some random topic that I just so happen to know enough about to write an essay on. I don't have really have any hobbies, so I can't just pick one out like many others can. The creative decision making part of me just isn't there. These assignments are mostly the same, so it gets quite repetitive after a while.</p3>
      <h2> 4) Teachers Love These Assignments</h2>
      <p4> Teachers tend to gravitate towards these kinds of assignments, especially during the first few weeks of school. There could be many reasons behind this, but it usually always happens at some point. Whether it being sharing your hobbies and facts with people around you, or an actual assignment based on your interests, teachers will always have one of these ready for some odd reason. It's understandable that they want to get to know their students better, but there certainly are more effective ways to do this for students who dislike sharing their personal interests.</p4>
      <h2> 5) General Discomfort</h2>
      <p5> Besides the difficulty of picking a topic, there's also the discomfort that comes along with writing about it. It may be uncomfortable to share personal interests to someone who is essentially your superior, as well as sharing them to other people. It brings a feeling of awkwardness when teachers tell their students to share their interests to each other, where the fear of judgement is definitely also there. </p5>
