      <h1>1) Lack of Ideas</h1>
      <p1> These types of "free and creative" assignments that allow you to do what you want is a real pain to deal with if you aren't one of those people with weirdly high imaginative capabilities. You often get stuck at choosing what to actually do, rather than doing the assignment itself. It becomes a huge problem where you have to desperately choose something to do, even if it may not be a good subject for the assignment.</p1>
      <h2>2) Expectations</h2>
      <p2>What also usually comes with these assignments are expectations of something great. Since you have the freedom to do whatever you want, people expect you to do your very best in whatever it is. It just really applies pressure and heavily affects one's decision making, knowing they might not bbe satisfied with the current state of your work.</p2>
      <h3>3) Time Constraints</h3>
      <p3> Since you likely spent an excessive time choosing what to do, you are left with little time to actually do it. The assignment usually gives more time before it's due than other work, but it really doesn't if you don't already know exactly what you want to do for it. You would spend all the time agonizing over what to do and be left with less time than usual to finish the assignment.</p3>
