      <h1>1) Lack of Ideas</h1>
      <p1> These types of "free" assignments that allow you to do what you want is a real pain to deal with if you aren't one of those people with weirdly high imaginative capabilities. You often get stuck at choosing what to actually do, rather than doing the assignment itself. It becomes a huge problem where you have to desparately choose something to do, even if it may not be a good subject for the assignment.</p1>
      <h2>2) Expectations</h2>
      <p2>What also usually comes with these assignments are expectations of something great. Since you have the freedom to do whatever you want, people expect you to do your very best in whatever it is. It just really applies pressure and heavily affects one's decision making, knowing they might not bbe satisfied with the current state of your work.</p2>
